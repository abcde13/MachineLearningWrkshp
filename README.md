The python notebook in this repo is for a talk I gave about Machine Learning on 30 April, 2015 at UCLA for ACM'S AI club. It was an introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn. 

In order to run the ipython notebook, just follow the steps below

    git clone https://github.com:abcde13/MachineLearningWrkshp.git
    cd MachineLearningWrkshp.git
    ipython notebook

There are 2 versions of the notebook, v3, and v4 (v4 has no version on it), which correspond with how nbconvert is creating the notebook.
Run whichever one currently works in your environment, they should be almost identical. The only reason I have two different versions
is due issues manifesting when converting the notebook to a presenation via the --to slides --post serve arguments for nbconvert.
